# TheTodoList

A full stack to-do application! This project is designed in mind to be built around to-do app functionalities with inital CRUD operations on a RESTful backend. Additional features will be added as well such as a calendar, customizable tags, deadlines, shared organization to-do lists, messaging services, etc. The intent behind this proejct is to build a full fleshed product, and learning new technologies.

## How Its Made
On the frontend, HTML/CSS, React + Typescript, and Mantine is used. On the backend is Java Springboot and a MySQL database. Security revolves around JWT Authentication. Additionally in the future OAuth + OIDC will be used as well.

More is to be added as I continue optimizing and adding new features!
